# eeg_python
This project is designed to perform topological barcode analysis for EEGs. 
Just open the .txt, add your file directory (has to be .edf if you using the raw file), copy into python line, and done. 
This is not a fast process. It is due to limitations in Python unfortunately.
Resize the EEG through the main code. 
More often than not, it will not process the whole EEG as one file even though this uses cython implement.
I plan on expanding the functionality of this.
