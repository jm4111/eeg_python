# eeg_python
This project is designed to perform topological barcode analysis for EEGs. 
Just open the .txt, add your file directory (has to be .edf if you using the raw file), copy into python line, and done. 
Unfortunately, his is not a fast process as it is due to limitations in Python.
Resize the EEG through the main code. 
More often than not, it will not process the whole EEG as one file even though this uses cython implement.I plan on expanding the functionality of this. 
This was made as a project for my Master's program at Nova Southeastern University.
